A record of the projects I completed

## Project 1: Interactive Dashboard for Hotel Bookings with Excel
### Overview
* Created an interactive dashboard using a hotel bookings dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand).
* Data wrangling is done using the Power Query editor in Excel.

### Thoughts:
* My first project in data analysis.
* While Excel is not cutting-edge, it has many nifty features that are helpful to make sense of data in a businesss setting.
* Excel's Power Query feature is pretty cool, it is so much faster to do data wrangling within the Power Query editor than regular Excel. 
* Overall, Excel was a good platform to learn the basics of data wrangling and data visualisation as Excel is something most people are familiar with.

## Project 2: Database Design and Writing Queries with SQL

### Overview
* Created a new database in MSSQL using two e-commerce datasets from Kaggle, which I merged. (https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) (https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/marketing-funnel-olist)
* In designing my database, I applied good practices of database design, e.g. database normalization, usage of primary keys and foreign keys.
* Wrote complex (relatively speaking) SQL queries (e.g. joins, groupby, functions, stored procedures, views) to extract data that I needed for analysis.
*  


### Thoughts:
* Although the dataset was large, there was a lack of data that led to useful business ins
* Hence, I felt the analytical portion of the project was unsatisfactory.
* The large


* Thereafter, I used Excel to perform data visualisation
* The purpose of this project is mainly to familiarise myself with SQL syntax, and be familiar with things like joins, functions, stored procedures, groupby and etc
