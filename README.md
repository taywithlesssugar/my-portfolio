A record of the projects I completed

## Project 1: Interactive Dashboard for Hotel Bookings with Excel
### Overview
* Created an interactive dashboard using a hotel bookings dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand).
* Data wrangling is done using the Power Query editor in Excel.
* With the dashboard, key trends and statistics about hotel bookings can viewed at a glance.
* Users could use the slicers to zoom in to particular subsets of the data they are intersted in.

### Thoughts:
* While Excel is not cutting-edge, it has many nifty features that are helpful to make sense of data in a businesss setting.
* Excel's Power Query feature is pretty cool, it is so much faster to do data wrangling within the Power Query editor than regular Excel. 
* Overall, Excel was a good platform to learn the basics of data wrangling and data visualisation as Excel is something most people are familiar with.\

## Project 2: Database Design and Writing Queries with SQL
\
### Overview
* Mainly an exercise in database design, writing SQL queries and data visualisation using Excel. 
* Created a new database in MSSQL using two Kaggle datasets, which I merged.
* The first dataset is an e-commerce dataset from the Brazilian company Olist. (https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce)
* The second dataset is a marketing funnel dataset from the same company. (https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/marketing-funnel-olist)
* Wrote a variety of SQL queries (e.g. joins, groupby, functions, stored procedures, views) to extract data that I needed for analysis.
* With the extracted data, I created an interactive dashboard in Excel that summarises the main insights from the dataset. \
\
### Thoughts:
* Before I started on the project I took a short course on the fundamentals of database design, where I learned about best practices in database design, such as database normalization (principles of organizing data to minimize redundancy), or the essentiality of primary keys for each data table.
* The project was a good opportunity for me to apply and practice what I have learned. \
